The German accented scientist weasel and the other lowly mustelid servants could perhaps be dubbed \"Axis of Weasels\". Bare in mind that this is not an official name for the characters. The reference in bearing is mostly directed to the scientist for his inscrutable German accent and the creation of the \"Tediz\" -- an obvious reference to Nazis.","ThumbsDown":2,"ThumbsUp":5,"DatePosted":"2007-06-16T00:00:00","Rank":1}
