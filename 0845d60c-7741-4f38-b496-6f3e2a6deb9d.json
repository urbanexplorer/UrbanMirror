He can bolt things on but doesn't truly know what the parts do and how they work. You can almost relate a bolt on boy to the local oil change technician. There is a difference of a performance shop and a racing shop. Performance shops buy parts from online or magazines and install them and that's it. A race shop will search for parts that suit a build, determine what parts are needed for the type of performance, and understand the fundamentals of performance.","ThumbsDown":0,"ThumbsUp":1,"DatePosted":"2017-02-06T00:00:00","Rank":1}
