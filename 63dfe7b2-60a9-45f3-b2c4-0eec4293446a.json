An act of dominating an opponent.\r\r2. Great, ingenious; applied to methods and objects.\r\rOriginally dates back to the days of WarCraft, when a map designer mispelled \"Own\" as \"Pwn\".  What was originally supose to be \"player has been owned.\" was \"player has been pwned\".\r\rPwn eventually grew from there and is now used throughout the online world, especially in online games.","ThumbsDown":1453,"ThumbsUp":12515,"DatePosted":"2003-09-01T00:00:00","Rank":1}
