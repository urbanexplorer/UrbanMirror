It can be used in the place of any word, in any language, except sneeze?! However, the term must only be used after the second word in the sentence. It must also be said in the voice of Jonathon Ross. The word itself can also just be used once in any particular sentence.","ThumbsDown":0,"ThumbsUp":1,"DatePosted":"2009-01-01T00:00:00","Rank":1}
