This animal is first derived from North London, England, UK but then migrated due to the fact he was so ratchet.A typical CoCo Janelle would wear Harry Potter-like glasses, will mostly wear jeans and a sweater to keep him sweater. He is also referred as peasant, due to his lowness in class system.He feeds off of the meat of a cow, and only pure white cows, in hopes that he will no longer be ratchet. Believed to be practicing Judaism and plays ratchet games when not in temple, which explains his IQ.","ThumbsDown":1,"ThumbsUp":2,"DatePosted":"2013-01-16T00:00:00","Rank":1}
