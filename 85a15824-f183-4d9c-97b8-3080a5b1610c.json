If executed properly, this causes great pain and feelings of sexual confusion to the victim, and usually leads to a pin. Outlawed in collegiate wrestling, this move has been used by notoriously \"dirty\" wrestlers/heals such as The Iron Sheik or Big Daddy Duker. \r\rReferred to as the \"the Coco Khourey Maneuver,\" or if you are into brevity, just, \"the Coco Khourey.\"\r\rAs Mr. Khoury's career fades into oblivion, his name and reputation live on through the maneuver he poineered.","ThumbsDown":6,"ThumbsUp":15,"DatePosted":"2006-04-27T00:00:00","Rank":1}
