A doughwindo will typically act extremely cocky when he's on the dance floor and constantly crash his moves since he doesn't actually know how to do them. He tends to use his inflated big ego to outweigh the fact that he utterly sucks at dancing. In other words, a doughwindo is the equivalent to living cancer in the world of dance.","ThumbsDown":1,"ThumbsUp":24,"DatePosted":"2015-07-16T00:00:00","Rank":1}
