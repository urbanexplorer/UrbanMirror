It becomes a competition of seeing who has the most friends, so you add everyone you've made eye contact with in the past 6 years, constantly posting bulletins telling people to comment on your NEW PICZ PLZ or die.  Also a way for every garage band ever to make a Myspace Music profile without even have talent and/or experience as other bands have.
