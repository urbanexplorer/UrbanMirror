He has a crazy side to him but only shows it infront of true friends. Has great style, is hilarious, amazing, caring, sweet and will make you smile. You will always have a good time with an Alexander, so if you got a friend named Alexander count yourself one of the luckiest people in the world!","ThumbsDown":2762,"ThumbsUp":11923,"DatePosted":"2010-02-04T00:00:00","Rank":1}
