A delightful and refreshing chilled summer treat made with all natural juices.\r2. The indescribably pleasurable experience derived from (a) inserting ice cubes in your mouth and then offering oral pleasure to your girlie, (b) then slowly inserting the ice cubes into her expectant poonanny, allowing them to melt and chill the surrounding love cave, and (c) then stuffing your hot big swinburne stick into her juicy chilled punch bowl.  Serves two.","ThumbsDown":16,"ThumbsUp":48,"DatePosted":"2005-06-29T00:00:00","Rank":1}
