Today Alpha Chi is still going strong with some of the most beautiful and succesful women you can find, and are known for helping the community. Beauty, brains, and a good reputation...what more could you ask for. Famous Alpha Chi's include Trista from ABC's the Bachlorette, Dawn Wells who played Mary Ann on Gilligan's Island, and my personal favorite, Condoleeza Rice. A lot of jealous people make rude comments, but we dont care because we know we're destined for success","ThumbsDown":43,"ThumbsUp":90,"DatePosted":"2007-12-07T00:00:00","Rank":1}
