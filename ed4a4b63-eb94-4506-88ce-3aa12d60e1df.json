But deep inside he has his own insecurities. He sees everything in a very different point of you then you would. He makes assumptions that aren’t true. He thinks everybody hates him but he’s actually a very loveabale guy. He’s sweet. He’s caring. Frsych will always be there for you. Frsych is a guy you would call a true friend. Besides his Demons and insecurities there is a guy who believes in himself, even if it’s in a very rare occasion, frsych will somehow have faith in himself. Never lose trust to a frsych because you won’t be able to get that back and soon you will regret leaving him behind.","ThumbsDown":0,"ThumbsUp":1,"DatePosted":"2019-02-04T00:00:00","Rank":1}
