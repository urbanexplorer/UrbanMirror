Instead, the word \"muff\" is an inoffensive, slang word for a vagina.  Muffs can range from dainty and tight to floppy and roast beef colored.  Some muffs smell fishy or sweaty, and others smell like skin or roses.  Some muffs are hairy, others are bare, and some have razor burn or ingrown hairs.  Females (and transexuals) of all ages have muffs.  There are baby muffs and grandma muffs.  Most muffs have a week of bleeding, unless the owner is on some sort of contraceptive (see: Depovera, Seasonal).  It is also the root word for Muffdiver, Muffed, and Muffdoctor.
