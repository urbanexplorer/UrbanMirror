This would hopefully work to distract the cameraman's attention from the facts that firstly, most of the seats in the chamber would be empty, and secondly most of the remainder would be occupied by MPs who were filling in crosswords, sleeping, or otherwise unengaged in parliamentary business.","ThumbsDown":6,"ThumbsUp":16,"DatePosted":"2007-11-18T00:00:00","Rank":1}
