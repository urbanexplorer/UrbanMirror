No questions, Cocolis is a very unfit name for humans, have you ever met a person who doesn't want a hug? Girl if not, you should go out on town more. Anyways, Cocolis' likes heights and are very hard to find. Cocolis' have a wonky run, never changes. If yes, it's not a Cocolis. Cocolis' are scared of almost everything and very picky in EVERYTHING (mostly food, but undercover)","ThumbsDown":0,"ThumbsUp":0,"DatePosted":"2019-03-22T00:00:00","Rank":1}
