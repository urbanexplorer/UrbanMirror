A virgin iceman is told that there is a neat \"frozen squirrel\" burried behind a pallet of ice in the freezer. When the new guy bends over to take a look, a veteran iceman jams his thumb as far as he can up the virgin iceman's ass and all present yell squirrel at the top of their loungs. This rite has recently found its way into college communities worldwide.","ThumbsDown":11,"ThumbsUp":8,"DatePosted":"2006-04-08T00:00:00","Rank":1}
