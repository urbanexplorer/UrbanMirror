It means black person in the same sense that gringo or yankee means white person. It can be a racial slur if the speaker wants it to be (just like gringo) but it is not a spanish word for nigger. It originally referred to blacks that came from english speaking Caribbean Islands and settled in spanish speaking islands.","ThumbsDown":64,"ThumbsUp":192,"DatePosted":"2006-05-12T00:00:00","Rank":1}
