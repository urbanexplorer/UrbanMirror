He has a huge heart and keeps his family and friends first. He may hurt people sometimes, but he never truly intends to even though it may seem like it. Axtin is a great person to have as a friend. He is a fighter but also a lover. He doesn't settle down because he knows it's hard to find someone good enough for him. Axtin is very social and everyone loves him. He is very easy to talk to, always supportive and is always waiting for you to come back when you've messed up, because underneath his shell is an amazing person.","ThumbsDown":0,"ThumbsUp":6,"DatePosted":"2018-08-12T00:00:00","Rank":1}
