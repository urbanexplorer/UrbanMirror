Coco Puffs are not marijuana joints with cocaine. That is called a joint laced with cocaine.Coco Puffs are smoked mostly by powder cocaine users who just want to ingest their cocaine in a different way. Usually made at the end of nights for some reason. Since they usually smoke, coco puffs are a welcome addition to the same old snorting. There are also the rare people who smoke weed, are anti-cocaine, but believe that if you smoke powder cocaine it is not addictive so if they are in a group of coke users, they will only smoke coco puffs if someone has one.You make a coco puff like this:-Slice a long slit down a cigarette with your razor blade trying not to fluff up the tobacco. Do not cut the whole thing open.\r-Sprinkle in some powder cocaine.\r-Carefully take a rolling paper and rip the 'glue' part. Lick it and seal the slit. Or, you can just re-role the whole cigarette with the rolling paper.Light and pass around. You will not notice a strong high unless you use powered crack cocaine. If you do use powdered down crack cocaine, it is no longer a coco puff.","ThumbsDown":121,"ThumbsUp":255,"DatePosted":"2009-12-14T00:00:00","Rank":1}
